_Vign is only vignetting

_Vign_NewFlu_0  is vignetting + fluctuation of photons before calculate sensor counting

_Vign_NewFlu_0_300rad is vignetting + fluctuation of photons before calculate sensor counting + production within 300 pixels from the center

_Vign_NewFlu_8Per_300rad  is vignetting + fluctuation of photons before calculate sensor counting + production within 300 pixels from the center + 8 percent gaussian fluctuation on hout
